# Features

Ilo provides the following features.

## Security First

Ilo was designed as a security-first platform, using modern algorithms (Such as Argon2id for hashing) and putting user privacy first. The platform was created as an inspiration for an end-to-end encrypted platform as users increasingly rely on platforms to communicate.

## Standards-based

The entire system is designed around OpenAPI and JSON Schema to conform to common practice in use today. The use of OpenAPI often can allow client code generation in many languages.

## Modern Technologies

All technologies behind the project are based on maximising the capabilities of each technology. Development of the Python codebase utilises type-hinting, new features such as the walrus operator, docstring and more. Elixir's concurrency is utilised to send messages without Python overhead.
